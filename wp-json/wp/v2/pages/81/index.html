The MIM&#8217;s admission fee for adults is $20. Although data from 2008 is quite outdated at this point, if museum admission prices remained the same relative to the rest of the economy, this would make the MIM&#8217;s admission price above average but still within the bounds of typical admission prices for museums. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center\">Is there anything the MIM can do to be more accessible? <\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The article written by Daniel Grant suggests that there are three main paths museums can take with respect to admission fees: <\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Maintaining High Fees<\/strong>: Some museums continue to charge high admission fees, often citing the need to cover operational costs and maintain the institution&#8217;s financial stability.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Offering Discounts<\/strong>: Many museums implement variable pricing structures, offering discounts for certain groups such as seniors, students, or military personnel. This approach aims to make visits more affordable for those who may be deterred by high ticket prices.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Eliminating Admission Fees<\/strong>: Some museums choose to eliminate admission fees entirely, either through corporate sponsorship or significant donations. This approach aims to remove financial barriers and make cultural experiences accessible to a broader audience.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The MIM has already taken steps to be more accessible by offering discounts, but it would be ideal if it could be accessible to all members of the community. However, is this feasible? The following are some challenges the MIM would face if it opted to eliminate admission fees:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Loss of revenue from admission fees may impact the museum&#8217;s ability to cover operational costs.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Reliance on alternative sources of funding, such as donations or sponsorships, may introduce financial uncertainty.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Increased visitor numbers could strain resources and facilities, potentially affecting the quality of the visitor experience.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, admission fees are challenging and nuanced issue for museums to navigate. I hope the MIM is making decisions that equitably weigh the financial needs of the museum with the mission of being an inclusive space for the community.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Reviews The reviews of the MIM are largely positive.
